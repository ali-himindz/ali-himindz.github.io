User stories are the basic building block in Agile approach for software development. User story is probably the most talked about subject in any agile team as User Stories concern all the stake-holders in the project. Besides their primary use of "capturing the functionality that will be valuable to user of a system or software", the user stories are used for several different purposes in any agile software development project life cycle, e.g. they are the basic constituent of Sprint planning, they also depict the velocity of the team, interdependencies in user stories help in resource scheduling, user stories are basis for any automated testing and last but not the least user stories are the basis of completion of the project for client and developer alike.

The structure and content of the user story depends on several factors, in the past 5 years I have worked on 6 unique projects in three continents of the world with six different teams varying not only in size and skills but coming from different cultural backgrounds. In this journey, I have worked with teams in very large enterprises to start-up developing the next generation technologies.  And I worked in China, North America, Europe, and virtual teams in India and Pakistan. The projects I worked consisted research based software project, next generation IoT, modern web and mobile application to large enterprise financial applications.

In this experience, only common part in the user stories I have come across is the start of the story with "As a ... " :) , I have written and seen user stories that consists of the algorithmic style if-then-else to single sentence. The user story that is concise enough to capture the functionality that is deliverable in a single day, to the user story that is big enough to capture the whole functionality of the project, the user story that serves as the pivot for a fully automated Continuous delivery pipeline to user story that have no test or automation aspects.
As I said in any project, the structure and content of the story depends on several factors within the team, I would try to list of them:
