Welcome to my blog on github pages, finally something that I might actually be inspired to blog more regularly. 
In the coming weeks, I will be migrating all my content to this blog. And then hopefully I would be writing a weekly blog on everything technical.
I must mention here that one of my favorite blogger <a target="_blank" href="https://wilsonmar.github.io/">Wilsonmar</a>, inspired me to move to github pages instead of maintaining my own wordpress blog.
