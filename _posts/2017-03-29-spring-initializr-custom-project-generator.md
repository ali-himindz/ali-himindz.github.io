*Spring Initializr is great tool to bootstrap your ÂµService, there is an [existing enhancement request](https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/340) for a custom DSL to customize the project generation.*

As part of my book, I had to extend the Spring Initializr project to allow me to overlay a custom project structure that included the CI/CD files. 
This is a simple, quick but not so dirty implementation, allowing you to provide a link to a zip file containing the files that you wish to overlay after the project has been generated by Spring Initializr.
You may download the forked project from [https://github.com/himindz/initializr](https://github.com/himindz/initializr)
